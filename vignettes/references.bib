  abstract = "This work evaluates the potential in diagnostic application of a
              new advanced neuroimaging method, which delineates the profile of
              tissue properties along the corticospinal tract (CST) in
              amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), by means of diffusion tensor
              imaging (DTI). Twenty-four ALS patients and twenty-four
              demographically matched healthy subjects were enrolled in this
              study. The Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ), a tool for the
              automatic reconstruction of white matter tract profiles, based on
              a deterministic tractography algorithm to automatically identify
              the CST and quantify its diffusion properties, was used. At a
              group level, the highest non-overlapping DTI-related differences
              were detected in the cerebral peduncle, posterior limb of the
              internal capsule, and primary motor cortex. Fractional anisotropy
              (FA) decrease and mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity
              (RD) increases were detected when comparing ALS patients to
              controls. The machine learning approach used to assess the
              clinical utility of this DTI tool revealed that, by combining all
              DTI metrics measured along tract between the cerebral peduncle
              and the corona radiata, a mean 5-fold cross validation accuracy
              of 80\% was reached in discriminating ALS from controls. Our
              study provides a useful new neuroimaging tool to characterize
              ALS-related neurodegenerative processes by means of CST profile.
              We demonstrated that specific microstructural changes in the
              upper part of the brainstem might be considered as a valid
              biomarker. With further validations this method has the potential
              to be considered a promising step toward the diagnostic utility
              of DTI measures in ALS. Hum Brain Mapp 38:727-739, 2017.

  abstract = "The white matter contains long-range connections between
              different brain regions and the organization of these connections
              holds important implications for brain function in health and
              disease. Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
              imaging (dMRI) to quantify tissue properties along the
              trajectories of these connections. Statistical inference from
              tractometry usually either averages these quantities along the
              length of each fiber bundle or computes regression models
              separately for each point along every one of the bundles. These
              approaches are limited in their sensitivity, in the former case,
              or in their statistical power, in the latter. We developed a
              method based on the sparse group lasso (SGL) that takes into
              account tissue properties along all of the bundles and selects
              informative features by enforcing both global and bundle-level
              sparsity. We demonstrate the performance of the method in two
              settings: i) in a classification setting, patients with
              amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are accurately distinguished
              from matched controls. Furthermore, SGL identifies the
              corticospinal tract as important for this classification,
              correctly finding the parts of the white matter known to be
              affected by the disease. ii) In a regression setting, SGL
              accurately predicts ``brain age.'' In this case, the weights are
              distributed throughout the white matter indicating that many
              different regions of the white matter change over the lifespan.
              Thus, SGL leverages the multivariate relationships between
              diffusion properties in multiple bundles to make accurate
              phenotypic predictions while simultaneously discovering the most
              relevant features of the white matter.",

              data in a manner that allows other labs to understand and
              reproduce published findings. Here we report a new open source
              tool, AFQ-Browser, that builds an interactive website as a
              companion to a diffusion MRI study. Because AFQ-Browser is
              portable---it runs in any web-browser---it can facilitate
              transparency and data sharing. Moreover, by leveraging new
              web-visualization technologies to create linked views between
              different dimensions of the dataset (anatomy, diffusion metrics,
              subject metadata), AFQ-Browser facilitates exploratory data
              analysis, fueling new discoveries based on previously published
              datasets. In an era where Big Data is playing an increasingly
              prominent role in scientific discovery, so will browser-based
